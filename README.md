When deploying a local server for testing it is advised to disable the browser's
cache. For Firefox user: open Developer Tools, open the Network tab, enable the
*Disable Cache* option.

Within the `layout/shortcodes/p` the `p` is a HTML `<p>`. Follow this pattern.

`<br>` tags must be on their own lines, not appended to the end of an existing
line.

Content within `src/content/site/` will be unlisted; in other words, webpages
within that directory will not be posted within a menu.

The official repository is located at:
[git.dhe.estate](https://git.dhe.estate/dhe-estate/.git). Collaboration occurs
at [Github](https://github.com/hunter-empire).
