# Welcome to the Discord of the Democratic Hunter Empire

## Our mission

The DHE is a roleplay nation on the Official Vampirism Server.

To spread equality, democracy, tranquility, protection, and light of day of
tomorrow we come together against Vampires and their dark promise.

For mankind shall we serve, bringing equality and prosperity for both Humans and
Hunters.

## Knowing each other

We would like to know you better so we have some simple questions. Please answer
these in your lobby ticket. If you're unsure of anything let us know! We'll help
out :)

- Your full Discord Name with ID (mention your alternating accounts, if
  existing).
- Your Minecraft account you intend to use (mention your alternating accounts,
  if existing).
- Your major faction (Human, Hunter, Vampire) and currect level.
- Your status on the Minecraft server (e.g. newcomer, long time player).
- Your playtime on the Server.
- Your base location (XYZ) and if you're interested in moving to the Capital
  Hunter Town.
- (Optional) Your preferred gender pronoun.

Consider sharing information about DHE adversaries that you may know ;)

## Ensuring things will be OK

Tell us a bit about your relationship with other players. In the past we often
get into problems with some of our previous members having conflicting
relationships inside Vampire groups we intended to adversary. *Note: It's okay
to be friends with Vampires outside roleplay, though we would like to know
rolepay relationships to prevent conflicts-of-interest.*

Why do you want to become a DHE member? What are your motives?

## Being admitted into the Discord

You made it! Welcome.

You'll notice that we nicked our Discord usernames into our Minecraft users. We
ask that you do the same so we know each other (in Discord and in Minecraft).

Happy hunting :)
